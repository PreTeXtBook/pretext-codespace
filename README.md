# PreTeXt Codespace

Use this template repository to quickly start a new [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) project entirely in the cloud, using GitHub Codespaces.  

## Instructions

Look for the green button at the very top right of this page.  The button should say `Use this template` (if not make sure you are logged in to GitHub). 
  
Click on the button and select "Create a new repository".  On the next page, give your project a name, select public or private (this can be changed later), and click the "Create repository from template" button.

You now have a GitHub repository saved in your account.  You can come back to that page any time you want to work on your project (note the URL or else find it in the list of your repositories when you log in to GitHub).

To start work on your project, go to the green button at the top of *your* repository's page, which will say `<> Code`.  

1. Click on this button.
2. Click on the tab that says "Codespaces."
3. Click "Create codespace on main."

This may take a minute or two (just the first time; later this will be faster) and then open a browser version of VS Code with everything set up to start working.  The first thing you should do is create a new PreTeXT project:

1. Open the command palette by hitting `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `F1`) and start typing "pretext new".  You will see a command titled "PreTeXt: New Project".
2. Hit `Enter` and select what sort of project you would like to create.  
3. Select the current suggested folder for the location of your project.

The window should reload and you will have your project there.  This readme will be gone, but you will get a new one with some new hints.

Next time you want to work on your book, return to your newly created repository, go to the green `<> Code` button, and select the codespace you previously created.  If you don't see that codespace (perhaps you deleted it to save space), you can always create a new codespace.
